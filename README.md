## ðŸš€ How to Run Locally

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```
    (Replace `<your-repository-url>` and `<your-repository-directory>` with your actual repository information.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas
    ```
    *(Note: Fuzzy matching is done using Pythonâ€™s `difflib` which is part of the standard library.)*

5.  **Place your datasets:**
    Make sure you have the following CSV files in the same directory as your Streamlit application:
    * `dataset.csv`
    * `movieIdTitles.csv`
    * `MovieRecommendations.csv`

6.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run your_app_name.py
    ```
    (Replace `your_app_name.py` with the actual name of your Streamlit script, likely `app.py` or similar.)

    Your web browser should automatically open to the Streamlit application. If not, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.
